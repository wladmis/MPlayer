Joe Barr became infamous in december 2001 by writing a less than favorable
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> review called
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32880.htm" target="_top"><span class="application">MPlayer</span>: The project from hell</a>.
He found <span class="application">MPlayer</span> hard to install, and concluded
that the developers were unfriendly and the documentation
incomplete and insulting. You be the judge of that.
He went on to mention Arpi negatively in his
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32887.htm" target="_top">10 Linux predictions for 2002</a>.
In a followup review of xine called
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/32716.htm" target="_top">A streaming media player for the rest of us</a>
he continued stirring up controversy. Ironically at the end of that article
he quotes his exchange with Günter Bartsch, the original author of <span class="application">xine</span>,
that perfectly summarizes the whole situation:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
However, he also went on to say that he was "surprised" by my column
about <span class="application">Mplayer</span> and thought it was unfair, reminding
me that it is a free software project. "If you don't like it,"
Bartsch said, "you're free not to use it."
</p></blockquote></div><p>

Almost two years later in october 2003 he wrote another review called
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/10/02/0343200" target="_top">Mplayer revisited</a>
(wrong spelling preserved).
In it he came to the following conclusions:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I would have to say that there have been improvements in the number of
features, in performance, and in documentation. It's still not the
easiest install in the world, especially for newbies, but it's a
little better than it used to be.
</p></blockquote></div><p>

and

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
But more importantly, I didn't notice any recent comments about user
abuse. I think I deserve some of the credit for that, even if I do say
so myself. Arpi and the rest of the project team must feel that way
too, because they have taken care to remember me in a special section
of the documentation included in the tarball. Like I said at the
start, some things haven't changed at all.
</p></blockquote></div><p>

We could not have summarized our feelings towards Joe Barr better:
"It's still not the fairest or best researched article in the world,
but it's better than it used to be." Hopefully the next time around
we will meet each other's expectations. However, the credit for maturity
goes to our increasing age only, and maybe to being weary of flame wars.
