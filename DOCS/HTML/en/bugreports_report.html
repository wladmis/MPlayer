First of all please try the latest CVS version of <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
as your bug might already be fixed there. Development moves extremely fast,
most problems in official releases are reported within days or even hours, so
please use <span class="bold"><b>only CVS</b></span> to report bugs. This
includes binary packages of <span class="application">MPlayer</span>. CVS
instructions can be found at the bottom of
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/dload.html" target="_top">this page</a> or in
the README. If this did not help please refer to the list of
<a href="bugs.html" title="Appendix C. Known bugs">known bugs</a> and the rest of the documentation. If your
problem is not known or not solvable by our instructions, then please report the bug.
</p><p>
Please do not send bug reports privately to individual developers. This is
community work and thus there might be several people interested in it. Sometimes
other users already experienced your troubles and know how to circumvent a problem
even if it is a bug in <span class="application">MPlayer</span> code.
</p><p>
Please describe your problem in as much detail as possible. Do a little detective
work to narrow down the circumstances under which the problem occurs. Does the bug
only show up in certain situations? Is it specific to certain files or file types?
Does it occur with only one codec or is it codec independent? Can you reproduce it
with all output drivers? The more information you provide the better are our
chances at fixing your problem. Please do not forget to also include the valuable
information requested below, we will be unable to properly diagnose your problem
otherwise.

An excellent and well written guide to asking questions in public forums is
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_top">How To Ask
Questions The Smart Way</a> by <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/" target="_top">Eric S. Raymond</a>.
There is another called
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html" target="_top">How to Report
Bugs Effectively</a> by <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/" target="_top">Simon Tatham</a>.
If you follow these guidelines you should be able to get help. But please
understand that we all follow the mailing lists voluntarily in our free time. We
are very busy and cannot guarantee that you will get a solution for your problem
or even an answer.
