For the complete list of available options, please read the man page.
The Syntax for a standard Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) is as follows:
<pre class="screen">mplayer dvd://<i><tt>&lt;track&gt;</tt></i> [-dvd-device <i><tt>&lt;device&gt;</tt></i>]</pre>
</p><p>
Example:
<pre class="screen">mplayer dvd://<i><tt>1</tt></i> -dvd-device <i><tt>/dev/hdc</tt></i></pre>
</p><p>
The default DVD device is <tt class="filename">/dev/dvd</tt>. If your setup
differs, make a symlink or specify the correct device on the command
line with the <tt class="option">-dvd-device</tt> option.
</p><p><b>New-style DVD support (mpdvdkit2). </b>
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> uses <tt>libdvdread</tt> and
<tt>libdvdcss</tt> for DVD decryption and playback. These two
libraries are contained in the <tt class="filename">libmpdvdkit2/</tt>
subdirectory of the <span class="application">MPlayer</span> source tree, you do not have
to install them separately. We opted for this solution because we had to fix a
<tt>libdvdread</tt> bug and apply a patch which adds
<span class="bold"><b>cracked CSS keys caching support</b></span> to
<tt>libdvdcss</tt> This results in a large speed increase because the
keys do not have to be cracked every time before playing.
</p><p>
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> can also use system-wide <tt>libdvdread</tt>
and <tt>libdvdcss</tt> libraries, but this solution is
<span class="bold"><b>not</b></span> recommended, as it can result in bugs,
library incompatibilities and slower speed.

In case of DVD decoding problems, try disabling supermount, or any other such
facilities.
</p></div><p><b>DVD structure. </b>
DVD disks have 2048 bytes per sector with ECC/CRC. They usually have an UDF
filesystem on a single track, containing various files (small .IFO and .BUK
files and big (1GB) .VOB files). They are real files and can be copied/played
from the mounted filesystem of an unencrypted DVD.
</p><p>
The .IFO files contain the movie navigation information (chapter/title/angle
map, language table, etc) and are needed to read and interpret the .VOB content
(movie). The .BUK files are backups of them. They use
<span class="bold"><b>sectors</b></span> everywhere, so you need to use raw
addressing of sectors of the disc to implement DVD navigation or decrypt the
content.
</p><p>
DVD support needs raw sector-based access to the device. Unfortunately you must
(under Linux) be root to get the sector address of a file. That's why we don't
use the kernel's filesystem driver at all, instead we reimplement it in
userspace. <tt>libdvdread</tt> 0.9.x and
<tt>libmpdvdkit</tt> do this. The kernel UDF filesystem driver
is not needed as they already have their own builtin UDF filesystem driver.
Also the DVD does not have to be mounted as only the raw sector-based access is
used.
</p><p>
Sometimes <tt class="filename">/dev/dvd</tt> cannot be read by users, so the
<tt>libdvdread</tt> authors implemented an emulation layer
which transfers sector addresses to filenames+offsets, to emulate raw
access on top of a mounted filesystem or even on a hard disk.
</p><p>
<tt>libdvdread</tt> even accepts the mountpoint instead of
the device name for raw access and checks <tt class="filename">/proc/mounts</tt>
to get the device name. It was developed for Solaris, where device names
are dynamically allocated.
</p><p>
The default DVD device is <tt class="filename">/dev/dvd</tt>. If your setup differs,
make a symlink, or specify the correct device on the command line with the
<tt class="option">-dvd-device</tt> option.
</p><p><b>DVD authentication. </b>
The authentication and decryption method of the new-style DVD support is done
using a patched <tt>libdvdcss</tt> (see above). The method can
be specified through the environment variable <tt>DVDCSS_METHOD</tt>,
which can be set to key, disk or title.
</p><p>
If nothing is specified it tries the following methods (default: key,
title request):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>bus key</b></span>: This key is negotiated during
authentication (a long mix of ioctls and various key exchanges, crypto
stuff) and is used to encrypt the title and disk keys before sending them
over the unprotected bus (to prevent eavesdropping). The bus key is needed
to get and predecrypt the crypted disk key.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>cached key</b></span>: <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
looks for already cracked title keys which are stored in the
<tt class="filename">~/.mplayer/DVDKeys</tt> directory (fast ;).
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>key</b></span>: If no cached key is available,
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> tries to decrypt the disk key with a set
of included player keys.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>disk</b></span>: If the key method fails
(e.g. no included player keys), <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
will crack the disk key using a brute force algorithm. This process
is CPU intensive and requires 64 MB of memory (16M 32Bit entries hash
table) to store temporary data. This method should always work (slow).
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>title request</b></span>: With the disk key
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> requests the crypted title keys,
which are inside <span class="emphasis"><i>hidden sectors</i></span> using <tt>ioctl()</tt>.
The region protection of RPC-2 drives is performed in this step and may fail on such drives.
If it succeeds, the title keys will be decrypted with the bus and disk key.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="bold"><b>title</b></span>: This method is used if the title
request failed and does not rely on any key exchange with the DVD drive.
It uses a crypto attack to guess the title key directly (by finding a
repeating pattern in the decrypted VOB content and guessing that the
plain text corresponding to the first encrypted bytes is a continuation
of that pattern). The method is also known as "known plaintext attack"
or "DeCSSPlus". In rare cases this may fail because there is not
enough encrypted data on the disk to perform a statistical attack or because
the key changes in the middle of a title. This method is the only way to
decrypt a DVD stored on a hard disk or a DVD with the wrong region on an
RPC2 drive (slow).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
RPC-1 DVD drives only protect region settings through software. RPC-2 drives
have a hardware protection that allows 5 changes only. It might be
needed/recommended to upgrade the firmware to RPC-1 if you have a RPC-2 DVD
drive. You can try finding firmware upgrades for your drive on the internet,
<a href="http://forum.rpc-1.com/dl_all.php" target="_top">this firmware forum</a>
may be a good starting point for your search.
If there is no firmware upgrade available for your device, use the
<a href="http://linvdr.org/projects/regionset/" target="_top">regionset tool</a>
to set the region code of your DVD drive (under Linux).
<span class="bold"><b>Warning</b></span>: You can only set the region 5 times.
