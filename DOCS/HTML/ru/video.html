It is VERY recommended to check if the MTRR registers
are set up properly, because they can give a big performance boost.
</p><p>
Do a <b>cat /proc/mtrr</b>:
<pre class="screen">
<tt>--($:~)--</tt> cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0xe4000000 (3648MB), size=  16MB: write-combining, count=9
reg01: base=0xd8000000 (3456MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1</pre>
</p><p>
It's right, shows my Matrox G400 with 16MB memory. I did this from
XFree 4.x.x , which sets up MTRR registers automatically.
</p><p>
If nothing worked, you have to do it manually. First, you have to find the
base address. You have 3 ways to find it:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
  from X11 startup messages, for example:
  <pre class="screen">
(--) SVGA: PCI: Matrox MGA G400 AGP rev 4, Memory @ 0xd8000000, 0xd4000000
(--) SVGA: Linear framebuffer at 0xD8000000</pre>
  </p></li><li><p>
  from <tt class="filename">/proc/pci</tt> (use <b>lspci -v</b>
  command):
  <pre class="screen">
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc.: Unknown device 0525
Memory at d8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
  </pre>
  </p></li><li><p>
  from mga_vid kernel driver messages (use <b>dmesg</b>):
  <pre class="screen">mga_mem_base = d8000000</pre>
  </p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
Then let's find the memory size. This is very easy, just convert video RAM
size to hexadecimal, or use this table:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>1 MB</td><td>0x100000</td></tr><tr><td>2 MB</td><td>0x200000</td></tr><tr><td>4 MB</td><td>0x400000</td></tr><tr><td>8 MB</td><td>0x800000</td></tr><tr><td>16 MB</td><td>0x1000000</td></tr><tr><td>32 MB</td><td>0x2000000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
</p><p>
You know base address and memory size, let's setup MTRR registers!
For example, for the Matrox card above (<tt>base=0xd8000000</tt>)
with 32MB ram (<tt>size=0x2000000</tt>) just execute:
<pre class="screen">
echo "base=0xd8000000 size=0x2000000 type=write-combining" &gt;| /proc/mtrr
</pre>
</p><p>
Not all CPUs have MTRRs. For example older K6-2 (around 266MHz,
stepping 0) CPUs don't have MTRRs, but stepping 12 does
(execute <b>cat /proc/cpuinfo</b> to check it).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="output-trad"></a>2.3.2. Video outputs for traditional video cards</h3></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="xv"></a>2.3.2.1. Xv</h4></div></div><p>
Under XFree86 4.0.2 or newer, you can use your card's hardware YUV routines
using the XVideo extension. This is what the option
'<tt class="option">-vo xv</tt>' uses. Also, this driver supports adjusting
brightness/contrast/hue/etc (unless you use the old, slow DirectShow DivX
codec, which supports it everywhere), see the man page.
</p><p>
In order to make this work, be sure to check the following:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
  You have to use XFree86 4.0.2 or newer (former versions don't have XVideo)
  </p></li><li><p>
  Your card actually supports hardware acceleration (modern cards do)
  </p></li><li><p>
  X loads the XVideo extension, it's something like this:
  <pre class="programlisting">(II) Loading extension XVideo</pre>

   This loads only the XFree86's extension. In a good install, this is
   always loaded, and doesn't mean that the <span class="bold"><b>card's</b></span>
   XVideo support is loaded!
  </p></div><p>
  </p></li><li><p>
  Your card has Xv support under Linux. To check, try
  <b>xvinfo</b>, it is the part of the XFree86 distribution. It
  should display a long text, similar to this:

Older 3dfx drivers were known to have problems with XVideo acceleration, it
didn't support either YUY2 or YV12, and so. Verify that you have XFree86
version 4.2.0 or greater, it works OK with YV12 and YUY2. Previous

If you experience strange effects using <tt class="option">-vo xv</tt>, try SDL

S3 Savage3D's should work fine, but for Savage4, use XFree86 version 4.0.3

xv support, but the card itself is very slow, so you better sell it.

It's currently unclear which Savage models lack YV12 support, and convert by
driver (slow). If you suspect your card, get a newer driver, or ask politely
on the MPlayer-users mailing list for an MMX/3DNow! enabled driver.

nVidia isn't always a very good choice under Linux (according to nVidia, this
is <a href="nvidia-opinions.html" title="E.3. nVidia">not true</a>)... XFree86's
open-source driver supports most of these cards, but for some cases, you'll
have to use the binary closed-source nVidia driver, available at
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html" target="_top">nVidia's web site</a>.
You'll always need this driver if you want 3D acceleration, too.
</p><p>
Riva128 cards don't have XVideo support with XFree86's nVidia driver :(
Complain to nVidia.
</p><p>
However, <span class="application">MPlayer</span> contains a
<a href="video.html#vidix" title="2.3.2.13. VIDIX">VIDIX</a> driver for most nVidia cards. Currently it
is in beta stage, and has some drawbacks. For more information, see

set refresh rate to a n*(fps of the movie) Hz.

Radeon VE - if you need X, use XFree86 4.2.0 or greater for this card.
No TV out support. Of course with <span class="application">MPlayer</span> you can

up to four times. The patch has been included in XFree86 CVS and should be in the

</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="dga"></a>2.3.2.2. DGA</h4></div></div><p><b>PREAMBLE. </b>
This document tries to explain in some words what DGA is in general and
what the DGA video output driver for <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
can do (and what it can't).
</p><p><b>WHAT IS DGA. </b>
DGA is short for <span class="emphasis"><i>Direct Graphics
Access</i></span> and is a means for a program to bypass the X server and
directly modifying the framebuffer memory. Technically spoken this happens
by mapping the framebuffer memory into the memory range of your process.
This is allowed by the kernel only if you have superuser privileges. You
can get these either by logging in as <tt>root</tt> or by setting the SUID bit on the
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> executable (<span class="bold"><b>not
recommended</b></span>).
</p><p>
There are two versions of DGA: DGA1 is used by XFree 3.x.x and DGA2 was
introduced with XFree 4.0.1.
</p><p>
DGA1 provides only direct framebuffer access as described above. For
switching the resolution of the video signal you have to rely on the
XVidMode extension.
</p><p>
DGA2 incorporates the features of XVidMode extension and also allows
switching the depth of the display. So you may, although basically
running a 32 bit depth X server, switch to a depth of 15 bits and vice
versa.
</p><p>
However DGA has some drawbacks. It seems it is somewhat dependent on the
graphics chip you use and on the implementation of the X server's video
driver that controls this chip. So it does not work on every system...
</p><p><b>INSTALLING DGA SUPPORT FOR MPLAYER. </b>
First make sure X loads the DGA extension, see in
<tt class="filename">/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt>:

<pre class="programlisting">(II) Loading extension XFree86-DGA</pre>

See, XFree86 4.0.x or greater is <span class="bold"><b>highly recommended</b></span>!
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s DGA driver is autodetected by
<tt class="filename">./configure</tt>, or you can force it
with <tt class="option">--enable-dga</tt>.
</p><p>
If the driver couldn't switch to a smaller resolution, experiment with
options <tt class="option">-vm</tt> (only with X 3.3.x), <tt class="option">-fs</tt>,
<tt class="option">-bpp</tt>, <tt class="option">-zoom</tt> to find a video mode that
the movie fits in. There is no converter right now :(
</p><p>
Become <tt>root</tt>. DGA needs root
access to be able to write directly video memory. If you want to run it as
user, then install <span class="application">MPlayer</span> SUID root:

<pre class="screen">
chown root <i><tt>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</tt></i>
chmod 750 <i><tt>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</tt></i>
chmod +s <i><tt>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</tt></i>
</pre>

Now it works as a simple user, too.
</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Security risk</h3><p>
This is a <span class="bold"><b>big</b></span> security risk!
<span class="bold"><b>Never</b></span> do this on a server or on a computer that can be
accessed by other people because they can gain root privileges through SUID root
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>.
</p></div><p>
Now use <tt class="option">-vo dga</tt> option, and there you go! (hope so:) You
should also try if the <tt class="option">-vo sdl:dga</tt> option works for you!
It's much faster!
</p><p><a name="dga-modelines"></a><b>RESOLUTION SWITCHING. </b>
The DGA driver allows for switching the resolution of the output signal.
This avoids the need for doing (slow) software scaling and at the same time
provides a fullscreen image. Ideally it would switch to the exact
resolution (except for honoring aspect ratio) of the video data, but the X
server only allows switching to resolutions predefined in
<tt class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt>
(<tt class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</tt> for XFree 4.X.X respectively).
Those are defined by so-called modelines and depend on
the capabilities of your video hardware. The X server scans this config
file on startup and disables the modelines not suitable for your hardware.
You can find out which modes survive with the X11 log file. It can be found
at: <tt class="filename">/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt>.
</p><p>
These entries are known to work fine with a Riva128 chip, using the nv.o X
server driver module.

</pre></p><p><b>DGA &amp; MPLAYER. </b>
DGA is used in two places with <span class="application">MPlayer</span>: The SDL
driver can be made to make use of it (<tt class="option">-vo sdl:dga</tt>) and
within the DGA driver (<tt class="option">-vo dga</tt>). The above said is true
for both; in the following sections I'll explain how the DGA driver for
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> works.
</p><p><b>FEATURES. </b>
The DGA driver is invoked by specifying <tt class="option">-vo dga</tt> at the
command line. The default behavior is to switch to a resolution matching
the original resolution of the video as close as possible. It deliberately
ignores the <tt class="option">-vm</tt> and <tt class="option">-fs</tt> options
(enabling of video mode switching and fullscreen) - it always tries to
cover as much area of your screen as possible by switching the video mode,
thus refraining from using additional cycles of your CPU to scale the
image. If you don't like the mode it chooses you may force it to choose
the mode matching closest the resolution you specify by <tt class="option">-x</tt>
and <tt class="option">-y</tt>. By providing the <tt class="option">-v</tt> option, the
DGA driver will print, among a lot of other things, a list of all
resolutions supported by your current <tt class="filename">XF86Config</tt> file.
Having DGA2 you may also force it to use a certain depth by using the
<tt class="option">-bpp</tt> option. Valid depths are 15, 16, 24 and 32. It
depends on your hardware whether these depths are natively supported or if
a (possibly slow) conversion has to be done.
</p><p>
If you should be lucky enough to have enough offscreen memory left to
put a whole image there, the DGA driver will use double buffering, which
results in much smoother movie playback. It will tell you whether
double buffering is enabled or not.
</p><p>
Double buffering means that the next frame of your video is being drawn in
some offscreen memory while the current frame is being displayed. When the
next frame is ready, the graphics chip is just told the location in memory
of the new frame and simply fetches the data to be displayed from there.
In the meantime the other buffer in memory will be filled again with new
video data.
</p><p>
Double buffering may be switched on by using the option
<tt class="option">-double</tt> and may be disabled with
<tt class="option">-nodouble</tt>. Current default option is to disable
double buffering. When using the DGA driver, onscreen display (OSD) only
works with double buffering enabled. However, enabling double buffering may
result in a big speed penalty (on my K6-II+ 525 it used an additional 20%
of CPU time!) depending on the implementation of DGA for your hardware.
</p><p><b>SPEED ISSUES. </b>
Generally spoken, DGA framebuffer access should be at least as fast as
using the X11 driver with the additional benefit of getting a fullscreen
image. The percentage speed values printed by
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> have to be interpreted with some care,
as for example, with the X11 driver they do not include the time used by
the X server needed for the actual drawing. Hook a terminal to a serial
line of your box and start <b>top</b> to see what is really
going on in your box.
</p><p>
Generally spoken, the speedup done by using DGA against 'normal' use of X11
highly depends on your graphics card and how well the X server module for it
is optimized.
</p><p>
If you have a slow system, better use 15 or 16 bit depth since they require
only half the memory bandwidth of a 32 bit display.
</p><p>
Using a depth of 24 bit is even a good idea if your card natively just supports
32 bit depth since it transfers 25% less data compared to the 32/32 mode.
</p><p>
I've seen some AVI files be played back on a Pentium MMX 266. AMD K6-2
CPUs might work at 400 MHZ and above.
</p><p><b>KNOWN BUGS. </b>
Well, according to some developers of XFree, DGA is quite a beast. They
tell you better not to use it. Its implementation is not always flawless
with every chipset driver for XFree out there.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
  With XFree 4.0.3 and <tt class="filename">nv.o</tt> there is a bug resulting
  in strange colors.
  </li><li>
  ATI driver requires to switch mode back more than once after finishing
  using of DGA.
  </li><li>
  Some drivers simply fail to switch back to normal resolution (use
  <span class="keycap"><b>Ctrl</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Alt</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Keypad +</b></span> and
  <span class="keycap"><b>Ctrl</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Alt</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>Keypad -</b></span>
  to switch back manually).
  </li><li>
  Some drivers simply display strange colors.
  </li><li>
  Some drivers lie about the amount of memory they map into the process's
  address space, thus vo_dga won't use double buffering (SIS?).
  </li><li>
  Some drivers seem to fail to report even a single valid mode. In this
  case the DGA driver will crash telling you about a nonsense mode of
  100000x100000 or something like that.
  </li><li>
  OSD only works with double buffering enabled (else it flickers).
  </li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sdl"></a>2.3.2.3. SDL</h4></div></div><p>
SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) is basically a unified
video/audio interface. Programs that use it know only about SDL, and not
about what video or audio driver does SDL actually use. For example a Doom
port using SDL can run on svgalib, aalib, X, fbdev, and others, you only
have to specify the (for example) video driver to use with the
<tt>SDL_VIDEODRIVER</tt> environment variable. Well, in theory.
</p><p>
With <span class="application">MPlayer</span>, we used its X11 driver's software
scaler ability for cards/drivers that doesn't support XVideo, until we made
our own (faster, nicer) software scaler. Also we used its aalib output, but
now we have ours which is more comfortable. Its DGA mode was better than
ours, until recently. Get it now? :)
</p><p>
It also helps with some buggy drivers/cards if the video is jerky (not slow
system problem), or audio is lagging.
</p><p>
SDL video output supports displaying subtitles under the movie, on the (if
present) black bar.

You'll have to install svgalib and its development package in order for
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> build its SVGAlib driver (autodetected,
but can be forced), and don't forget to edit
<tt class="filename">/etc/vga/libvga.config</tt> to suit your card and monitor.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#1047;&#1072;&#1084;&#1077;&#1095;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;</h3><p>
Be sure not to use the <tt class="option">-fs</tt> switch, since it toggles the
usage of the software scaler, and it's slow. If you really need it, use the
<tt class="option">-sws 4</tt> option which will produce bad quality, but is
somewhat faster.
</p></div><p><b>EGA (4BPP) SUPPORT. </b>
SVGAlib incorporates EGAlib, and <span class="application">MPlayer</span> has the
possibility to display any movie in 16 colors, thus usable in the following
sets:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
  EGA card with EGA monitor: 320x200x4bpp, 640x200x4bpp, 640x350x4bpp
  </li><li>
  EGA card with CGA monitor: 320x200x4bpp, 640x200x4bpp
  </li></ul></div><p>
The bpp (bits per pixel) value must be set to 4 by hand:
<tt class="option">-bpp 4</tt>
</p><p>
The movie probably must be scaled down to fit in EGA mode:
<pre class="screen">-vf scale=640:350</pre>
or
<pre class="screen">-vf scale=320:200</pre>
</p><p>
For that we need fast but bad quality scaling routine:
<pre class="screen">-sws 4</pre>
</p><p>
Maybe automatic aspect correction has to be shut off:
<pre class="screen">-noaspect</pre>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#1047;&#1072;&#1084;&#1077;&#1095;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;</h3><p>
According to my experience the best image quality on
EGA screens can be achieved by decreasing the brightness a bit:
<tt class="option">-vf eq=-20:0</tt>. I also needed to lower the audio
samplerate on my box, because the sound was broken on 44kHz:
<tt class="option">-srate 22050</tt>.
</p></div><p>
You can turn on OSD and subtitles only with the <tt class="option">expand</tt>
filter, see the man page for exact parameters.

Whether to build the FBdev target is autodetected during
<tt class="filename">./configure</tt>. Read the framebuffer documentation in
the kernel sources (<tt class="filename">Documentation/fb/*</tt>) for more
information.
</p><p>
If your card doesn't support VBE 2.0 standard (older ISA/PCI cards, such as
S3 Trio64), only VBE 1.2 (or older?): Well, VESAfb is still available, but
you'll have to load SciTech Display Doctor (formerly UniVBE) before booting
Linux. Use a DOS boot disk or whatever. And don't forget to register your
UniVBE ;))
</p><p>
The FBdev output takes some additional parameters above the others:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">-fb</tt></span></dt><dd>

This is Linux only! On non-Linux (tested on FreeBSD) systems, you can use
<a href="video.html#vidix" title="2.3.2.13. VIDIX">VIDIX</a> instead!
</p></div><div class="procedure"><p><b>Installation:</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
  To use it, you first have to compile <tt class="filename">mga_vid.o</tt>:
  <pre class="screen">

  </p></li><li><p>
  Then create <tt class="filename">/dev/mga_vid</tt> device:
  <pre class="screen">mknod /dev/mga_vid c 178 0</pre>
  and load the driver with
  <pre class="screen">insmod mga_vid.o</pre>
  </p></li><li><p>
  You should verify the memory size detection using the
  <b>dmesg</b> command. If it's bad, use the
  <tt class="option">mga_ram_size</tt> option
  (<b>rmmod mga_vid</b> first),
  specify card's memory size in MB:
  <pre class="screen">insmod mga_vid.o mga_ram_size=16</pre>
  </p></li><li><p>
  To make it load/unload automatically when needed, first insert the
  following line at the end of <tt class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</tt>:

  <pre class="programlisting">alias char-major-178 mga_vid</pre>

  Then copy the <tt class="filename">mga_vid.o</tt> module to the appropriate
  place under <tt class="filename">/lib/modules/<i><tt>kernel
  version</tt></i>/<i><tt>somewhere</tt></i></tt>.
  </p><p>
  Then run
  <pre class="screen">depmod -a</pre>
  </p></li><li><p>
  Now you have to (re)compile <span class="application">MPlayer</span>,
  <tt class="filename">./configure</tt> will detect
  <tt class="filename">/dev/mga_vid</tt> and build the 'mga' driver. Using it
  from <span class="application">MPlayer</span> goes by <tt class="option">-vo mga</tt>
  if you have matroxfb console, or <tt class="option">-vo xmga</tt> under XFree86
  3.x.x or 4.x.x.
  </p></li></ol></div><p>
The mga_vid driver cooperates with Xv.
</p><p>
The <tt class="filename">/dev/mga_vid</tt> device file can be read for some
info, for example by
<pre class="screen">cat /dev/mga_vid</pre>
and can be written for brightness change:

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="tdfxfb"></a>2.3.2.7. 3Dfx YUV support</h4></div></div><p>
This driver uses the kernel's tdfx framebuffer driver to play movies with

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="opengl"></a>2.3.2.8. OpenGL output</h4></div></div><p>
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> supports displaying movies using OpenGL,
but if your platform/driver supports xv as should be the case on a PC with
Linux, use xv instead, OpenGL performance is considerably worse. If you
have an X11 implementation without xv support, OpenGL is a viable
alternative.
</p><p>
Unfortunately not all drivers support this feature. The Utah-GLX drivers
(for XFree86 3.3.6) support it for all cards.
See <a href="http://utah-glx.sf.net" target="_top">http://utah-glx.sf.net</a> for details about how to

XFree86(DRI) 4.0.3 or later supports OpenGL with Matrox and Radeon cards,
4.2.0 or later supports Rage128.

instructions.
</p><p>
A hint from one of our users: the GL video output can be used to get

The rendering is very CPU intensive, especially when using AA-on-X
(using aalib on X), and it's least CPU intensive on standard,
non-framebuffer console. Use SVGATextMode to set up a big textmode,
then enjoy! (secondary head Hercules cards rock :)) (but IMHO you
can use <tt class="option">-vf 1bpp</tt> option to get graphics on hgafb:)
</p></div><p>
Use the <tt class="option">-framedrop</tt> option if your computer isn't fast

</p><p>
Playing on terminal you'll get better speed and quality using the Linux
driver, not curses (<tt class="option">-aadriver linux</tt>). But therefore you
need write access on

This driver was designed and introduced as a <span class="bold"><b>generic
driver</b></span> for any video card which has VESA VBE 2.0 compatible
BIOS. Another advantage of this driver is that it tries to force TV output
on.
<i>VESA BIOS EXTENSION (VBE) Version 3.0 Date: September 16,
1998</i> (Page 70) says:
</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><b>Dual-Controller Designs. </b>
VBE 3.0 supports the dual-controller design by assuming that since both
controllers are typically provided by the same OEM, under control of a
single BIOS ROM on the same graphics card, it is possible to hide the fact
that two controllers are indeed present from the application. This has the
limitation of preventing simultaneous use of the independent controllers,
but allows applications released before VBE 3.0 to operate normally. The
VBE Function 00h (Return Controller Information) returns the combined
information of both controllers, including the combined list of available
modes. When the application selects a mode, the appropriate controller is
activated. Each of the remaining VBE functions then operates on the active
controller.
</p></blockquote><p>
So you have chances to get working TV-out by using this driver.
(I guess that TV-out frequently is standalone head or standalone output
at least.)
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p><b>ADVANTAGES</b></p><ul type="disc" compact><li>
  You have chances to watch movies <span class="bold"><b>if Linux even doesn't
  know</b></span> your video hardware.
  </li><li>
  You don't need to have installed any graphics' related things on your
  Linux (like X11 (AKA XFree86), fbdev and so on). This driver can be run
  from <span class="bold"><b>text-mode</b></span>.
  </li><li>
  You have chances to get <span class="bold"><b>working TV-out</b></span>.
  (It's known at least for ATI's cards).
  </li><li>
  This driver calls <tt>int 10h</tt> handler thus it's not
  an emulator - it calls <span class="bold"><b>real</b></span> things of
  <span class="emphasis"><i>real</i></span> BIOS in <span class="emphasis"><i>real-mode</i></span>
  (actually in vm86 mode).
  </li><li>
  You can use VIDIX with it, thus getting accelerated video display
  <span class="bold"><b>and</b></span> TV output at the same time!
  (Recommended for ATI cards.)
  </li><li>
  If you have VESA VBE 3.0+, and you had specified
  <tt class="option">monitor-hfreq, monitor-vfreq, monitor-dotclock</tt> somewhere
  (config file, or command line) you will get the highest possible refresh rate.

  If you have installed <span class="bold"><b>NLS</b></span> font on your
  Linux box and run VESA driver from text-mode then after terminating
  <span class="application">MPlayer</span> you will have
  <span class="bold"><b>ROM font</b></span> loaded instead of national.
  You can load national font again by using <b>setsysfont</b>
  utility from the Mandrake distribution for example.
  (<span class="bold"><b>Hint</b></span>: The same utility is used for
  localization of fbdev).
  </li><li>
  Some <span class="bold"><b>Linux graphics drivers</b></span> don't update
  active <span class="bold"><b>BIOS mode</b></span> in DOS memory.
  So if you have such problem - always use VESA driver only from
  <span class="bold"><b>text-mode</b></span>. Otherwise text-mode (#03) will
  be activated anyway and you will need restart your computer.
  </li><li>
  Often after terminating VESA driver you get <span class="bold"><b>black</b></span>
  screen. To return your screen to original state - simply switch to other console
  (by pressing <span class="keycap"><b>Alt</b></span>+<span class="keycap"><b>F&lt;x&gt;</b></span>)
  then switch to your previous console by the same way.
  </li><li>
  To get <span class="bold"><b>working TV-out</b></span> you need have plugged

Avoid if possible. Outputs to X11 (uses shared memory extension), with no
hardware acceleration at all. Supports (MMX/3DNow/SSE accelerated, but
still slow) software scaling, use the options <tt class="option">-fs -zoom</tt>.
Most cards have hardware scaling support, use the <tt class="option">-vo xv</tt>
output for them, or <tt class="option">-vo xmga</tt> for Matrox cards.
</p><p>
The problem is that most cards' driver doesn't support hardware
acceleration on the second head/TV. In those cases, you see green/blue
colored window instead of the movie. This is where this driver comes in
handy, but you need powerful CPU to use software scaling. Don't use the SDL
driver's software output+scaler, it has worse image quality!
</p><p>
Software scaling is very slow, you better try changing video modes instead.
It's very simple. See the <a href="video.html#dga-modelines">DGA section's
modelines</a>, and insert them into your <tt class="filename">XF86Config</tt>.

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li>

  </li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
If you can't find the modes you inserted, browse XFree86's output. Some

video modes.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="vidix"></a>2.3.2.13. VIDIX</h4></div></div><p><b>PREAMBLE. </b>
VIDIX is the abbreviation for <span class="bold"><b>VID</b></span>eo
<span class="bold"><b>I</b></span>nterface for *ni<span class="bold"><b>X</b></span>.
VIDIX was designed and introduced as an interface for fast user-space drivers
providing such video performance as mga_vid does for Matrox cards. It's also very
portable.
</p><p>
This interface was designed as an attempt to fit existing video
acceleration interfaces (known as mga_vid, rage128_vid, radeon_vid,
pm3_vid) into a fixed scheme. It provides a high level interface to chips
which are known as BES (BackEnd scalers) or OV (Video Overlays). It doesn't
provide low level interface to things which are known as graphics servers.
(I don't want to compete with X11 team in graphics mode switching). I.e.
main goal of this interface is to maximize the speed of video playback.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p><b>USAGE</b></p><ul type="disc" compact><li>
  You can use standalone video output driver: <tt class="option">-vo xvidix</tt>.
  This driver was developed as X11's front end to VIDIX technology. It
  requires X server and can work only under X server. Note that, as it directly
  accesses the hardware and circumvents the X driver, pixmaps cached in the
  graphics card's memory may be corrupted. You can prevent this by limiting
  the amount of video memory used by X with the XF86Config option "VideoRam"
  in the device section. You should set this to the amount of memory installed
  on your card minus 4MB. If you have less than 8MB of video ram, you can use
  the option "XaaNoPixmapCache" in the screen section instead.
  </li><li>
  There is a console VIDIX driver: <tt class="option">-vo cvidix</tt>.
  This requires a working and initialized framebuffer for most cards (or else
  you'll just mess up the screen), and you'll have a similar effect as with
  <tt class="option">-vo mga</tt> or <tt class="option">-vo fbdev</tt>. nVidia cards however
  are able to output truly graphical video on a real text console. See the
  <a href="video.html#vidix-nvidia" title="2.3.2.13.5. nVidia cards">nvidia_vid</a> section for more information.
  </li><li>
  You can use VIDIX subdevice which was applied to several video output
  drivers, such as: <tt class="option">-vo vesa:vidix</tt>
  (<span class="bold"><b>Linux only</b></span>) and
  <tt class="option">-vo fbdev:vidix</tt>.
  </li></ul></div><p>
Indeed it doesn't matter which video output driver is used with
<span class="bold"><b>VIDIX</b></span>.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></p><ul type="disc" compact><li>
  Video card should be in graphics mode (except nVidia cards with the
  <tt class="option">-vo cvidix</tt> output driver).
  </li><li>
  <span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s video output driver should know
  active video mode and be able to tell to VIDIX subdevice some video
  characteristics of server.
  </li></ul></div><p><b>USAGE METHODS. </b>
When VIDIX is used as <span class="bold"><b>subdevice</b></span> (<tt class="option">-vo
vesa:vidix</tt>) then video mode configuration is performed by video
output device (<span class="bold"><b>vo_server</b></span> in short). Therefore you can
pass into command line of <span class="application">MPlayer</span> the same keys
as for vo_server. In addition it understands <tt class="option">-double</tt> key
as globally visible parameter. (I recommend using this key with VIDIX at
least for ATI's card). As for <tt class="option">-vo xvidix</tt>, currently it
recognizes the following options: <tt class="option">-fs -zoom -x -y -double</tt>.
</p><p>
Also you can specify VIDIX's driver directly as third subargument in
command line:

<pre class="screen">mplayer -vo xvidix:mga_vid.so -fs -zoom -double <i><tt>file.avi</tt></i></pre>
or
<pre class="screen">mplayer -vo vesa:vidix:radeon_vid.so -fs -zoom -double -bpp 32 <i><tt>file.avi</tt></i></pre>

But it's dangerous, and you shouldn't do that. In this case given driver
will be forced and result is unpredictable (it may
<span class="bold"><b>freeze</b></span> your computer). You should do that
ONLY if you are absolutely sure it will work, and
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> doesn't do it automatically. Please tell
about it to the developers. The right way is to use VIDIX without arguments
to enable driver autodetection.
</p><p>
VIDIX is new technology and it's extremely possible that on your
system it won't work. In this case only solution for you
it's port it (mainly libdha). But there is hope that it will work on those
systems where X11 does.
</p><p>
Since VIDIX requires direct hardware access you can either run it as root
or set the SUID bit on the <span class="application">MPlayer</span> binary
(<span class="bold"><b>Warning: This is a security risk!</b></span>).
Alternatively, you can use a special kernel module, like this:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
  Download the <a href="http://www.arava.co.il/matan/svgalib/" target="_top">development version</a>

  download a version made by Alex especially for usage with <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
  (it doesn't need the svgalib source to compile) from
  <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/~alex/svgalib_helper-1.9.17-mplayer.tar.bz2" target="_top">here</a>.
  </p></li><li><p>
  Compile the module in the <tt class="filename">svgalib_helper</tt>

  </p></li><li><p>
  To create the necessary devices in the <tt class="filename">/dev</tt>

There's a relatively new nVidia driver out there, it's known to work on Riva
128, TNT and GeForce2 chipsets, also others have been reported working.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p><b>LIMITATIONS</b></p><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>
  It's recommended to use the binary nVidia drivers for X before using this
  VIDIX driver, because some of the registers which need to be initialized
  haven't been discovered yet, so it will probably fail with the Open Source
  XFree86 <tt class="filename">nv.o</tt> driver.
  </p></li><li><p>
  Currently only codecs capable of UYVY colorspace output
  can work in conjunction with this driver. Unfortunately, this excludes
  every single decoder from the
  <tt>libavcodec</tt> family. This leaves
  us with the following usable popular codecs:
  <tt>cvid, divxds, xvid, divx4, wmv7, wmv8</tt> and some
  others. Please note that this is only
  a temporal inconvenience. The usage syntax is as follows:
  <pre class="screen">
    mplayer -vf format=uyvy -vc divxds <i><tt>divx3file.avi</tt></i>
  </pre>
  </p></li></ul></div><p>
  An unique feature of the nvidia_vid driver is its ability to display video on
  <span class="bold"><b>plain, pure, text-only console</b></span> - with no
  framebuffer or X magic whatsoever. For this purpose, we'll have to use the
  <tt class="option">cvidix</tt> video output, as the following example shows:
  <pre class="screen">
    mplayer -vf format=uyvy -vc divxds -vo cvidix <i><tt>example.avi</tt></i>

<span class="application">MPlayer</span> supports cards with the Siemens DVB chipset
from vendors like Siemens, Technotrend, Galaxis or Hauppauge. The latest DVB
drivers are available from the <a href="http://www.linuxtv.org" target="_top">Linux TV site</a>.
If you want to do software transcoding you should have at least a 1GHz CPU.
</p><p>
Configure should detect your DVB card. If it did not, force detection with
</p><p><pre class="screen">./configure --enable-dvb</pre></p><p>If you have ost headers at a non-standard path, set the path with</p><p><pre class="screen">./configure --with-extraincdir=<i><tt>DVB source directory</tt></i>/ost/include
</pre></p><p>Then compile and install as usual.</p><p><b>USAGE. </b>
Hardware decoding (playing standard MPEG-1/2 files) can be done with this command:
</p><p>
<pre class="screen">mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes <i><tt>file.mpg|vob</tt></i></pre>
</p><p>
Software decoding or transcoding different formats to MPEG-1 can be achieved using
a command like this:
</p><p><pre class="screen">
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes <i><tt>yourfile.ext</tt></i>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf expand <i><tt>yourfile.ext</tt></i>
</pre></p><p>
Note that DVB cards only support heights 288 and 576 for PAL or 240 and 480 for
NTSC. You <span class="bold"><b>must</b></span> rescale for other heights by adding
<tt class="option">scale=width:height</tt> with the width and height you want to the
<tt class="option">-vf</tt> option. DVB cards accept various widths, like 720, 704,
640, 512, 480, 352 etc and do hardware scaling in horizontal direction, so you
do not need to scale horizontally in most cases. For a 512x384 (aspect 4:3)
MPEG-4 (DivX) try:
</p><p><pre class="screen">mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=512:576</pre></p><p>If you have a widescreen movie and you do not want to scale it to full height,
you can use the <tt class="option">expand=w:h</tt> filter to add black bands. To view a
640x384 MPEG-4 (DivX), try:
</p><p>
<pre class="screen">mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf expand=640:576 <i><tt>file.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
If your CPU is too slow for a full size 720x576 MPEG-4 (DivX), try downscaling:
</p><p>
<pre class="screen">mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=352:576 <i><tt>file.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>If speed does not improve, try vertical downscaling, too:</p><p>
<pre class="screen">mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=352:288 <i><tt>file.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
For OSD and subtitles use the OSD feature of the expand filter. So, instead of
<tt class="option">expand=w:h</tt> or <tt class="option">expand=w:h:x:y</tt>, use
<tt class="option">expand=w:h:x:y:1</tt> (the 5th parameter <tt class="option">:1</tt>
at the end will enable OSD rendering). You may want to move the image up a bit
to get a bigger black zone for subtitles. You may also want to move subtitles up,
if they are outside your TV screen, use the <tt class="option">-subpos &lt;0-100&gt;</tt>
option to adjust this (<tt class="option">-subpos 80</tt> is a good choice).
</p><p>
In order to play non-25fps movies on a PAL TV or with a slow CPU, add the
<tt class="option">-framedrop</tt> option.
</p><p>
To keep the aspect ratio of MPEG-4 (DivX) files and get the optimal scaling
parameters (hardware horizontal scaling and software vertical scaling
while keeping the right aspect ratio), use the new dvbscale filter:
</p><p><pre class="screen">
for a  4:3 TV: -vf dvbscale,scale=-1:0,expand=-1:576:-1:-1:1
for a 16:9 TV: -vf dvbscale=1024,scale=-1:0,expand=-1:576:-1:-1:1
</pre></p><p><b>Digital TV (DVB input module). </b>You can use your DVB card for watching Digital TV.</p><p>

compilation should go without problems.

<tt class="option">overlay</tt> activates the overlay instead of TVOut. It requires
that you have a properly configured overlay setup to work right. The easiest
way to configure the overlay is to first run autocal. Then run mplayer with
dxr3 output and without overlay turned on, run dxr3view. In dxr3view you can
tweak the overlay settings and see the effects in realtime, perhaps this feature
will be supported by the <span class="application">MPlayer</span> GUI in the future.
When overlay is properly set up you will no longer need to use dxr3view.
<tt class="option">prebuf</tt> turns on prebuffering. Prebuffering is a feature of the
em8300 chip that enables it to hold more than one frame of video at a time. This
means that when you are running with prebuffering <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
will try to keep the video buffer filled with data at all times. If you are on
a slow machine <span class="application">MPlayer</span> will probably use close to,
or precisely 100% of CPU. This is especially common if you play pure MPEG streams
(like DVDs, SVCDs a.s.o.) since <span class="application">MPlayer</span> will not have
to reencode it to MPEG it will fill the buffer very fast.
With prebuffering video playback is <span class="bold"><b>much</b></span>
less sensitive to other programs hogging the CPU, it will not drop frames unless
applications hog the CPU for a long time.
When running without prebuffering the em8300 is much more sensitive to CPU load,
so it is highly suggested that you turn on <span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s
<tt class="option">-framedrop</tt> option to avoid further loss of sync.
<tt class="option">sync</tt> will turn on the new sync-engine. This is currently an
experimental feature. With the sync feature turned on the em8300's internal clock
will be monitored at all times, if it starts to deviate from
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s clock it will be reset causing the em8300 to
drop any frames that are lagging behind.
<tt class="option">norm=x</tt> will set the TV norm of the DXR3 card without the need
for external tools like em8300setup. Valid norms are 5 = NTSC, 4 = PAL-60,
3 = PAL. Special norms are 2 (auto-adjust using PAL/PAL-60) and 1 (auto-adjust
using PAL/NTSC) because they decide which norm to use by looking at the frame
rate of the movie. norm = 0 (default) does not change the current norm.
<tt class="option"><i><tt>device</tt></i></tt> = device number to use if you have more than one em8300
card.
Any of these options may be left out.
<tt class="option">:prebuf:sync</tt> seems to work great when playing MPEG-4 (DivX) movies. People
have reported problems using the prebuf option when playing MPEG-1/2 files. You
might want to try running without any options first, if you have sync problems,
or DVD subtitle problems, give <tt class="option">:sync</tt> a try.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">-ao oss:/dev/em8300_ma-<i><tt>X</tt></i></tt></span></dt><dd><p>

The em8300 cannot play back samplerates lower than 44100Hz. If the sample
rate is below 44100Hz select either 44100Hz or 48000Hz depending on which
one matches closest. I.e. if the movie uses 22050Hz use 44100Hz as
44100 / 2 = 22050, if it is 24000Hz use 48000Hz as 48000 / 2 = 24000 and so on.
This does not work with digital audio output (<tt class="option">-ac hwac3</tt>).
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">-vf lavc/fame</tt></span></dt><dd><p>
To watch non-MPEG content on the em8300 (i.e. MPEG-4 (DivX) or RealVideo)
you have to specify an MPEG-1 video filter such as
<tt>libavcodec</tt> (lavc) or
<tt>libfame</tt> (fame). At
the moment lavc is both faster and gives better image quality, it is suggested
that you use that unless you have problems with it. See the man page for further
info about <tt class="option">-vf lavc/fame</tt>.
Using lavc is highly recommended. Currently there is no way of setting the fps
of the em8300 which means that it is fixed to 30000/1001 fps. Because of this it is
highly recommended that you use <tt class="option">-vf lavc=<i><tt>quality</tt></i>:25</tt>
especially if you are using prebuffering. Then why 25 and not 30000/1001? Well, the
thing is that when you use 30000/1001 the picture becomes a bit jumpy. The reason for
this is unknown to us. If you set it to somewhere between 25 and 27 the picture
becomes stable. For now all we can do is accept this for a fact.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">-vf expand=-1:-1:-1:-1:1</tt></span></dt><dd><p>
Although the DXR3 driver can put some OSD onto the MPEG-1/2/4 video, it has
much lower quality than <span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s traditional OSD,
and has several refresh problems as well. The command line above will firstly
convert the input video to MPEG-4 (this is mandatory, sorry), then apply an
expand filter which won't expand anything (-1: default), but apply the normal
OSD onto the picture (that's what the "1" at the end does).
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt class="option">-ac hwac3</tt></span></dt><dd><p>
The em8300 supports playing back AC3 audio (surround sound) through the
digital audio output of the card. See the <tt class="option">-ao oss</tt> option above,
it must be used to specify the DXR3's output instead of a sound card.

This is a display-driver (<tt class="option">-vo zr</tt>) for a number of MJPEG
capture/playback cards (tested for DC10+ and Buz, and it should work for the
LML33, the DC10). The driver works by encoding the frame to JPEG and then
sending it to the card. For the JPEG encoding
<tt>libavcodec</tt>
is used, and required. With the special <span class="emphasis"><i>cinerama</i></span> mode,
you can watch movies in true wide screen provided that you have two beamers
and two MJPEG cards. Depending on resolution and quality settings, this driver
may require a lot of CPU power, remember to specify <tt class="option">-framedrop</tt>
if your machine is too slow. Note: My AMD K6-2 350MHz is (with
<tt class="option">-framedrop</tt>) quite adequate for watching VCD sized material and
downscaled movies.
</p><p>
This driver talks to the kernel driver available at
<a href="http://mjpeg.sf.net" target="_top">http://mjpeg.sf.net</a>, so
you must get it working first. The presence of an MJPEG card is autodetected by the
<tt class="filename">configure</tt> script, if autodetection fails, force detection with
<pre class="screen">./configure --enable-zr</pre>
</p><p>
The output can be controlled by several options, a long description of the
options can be found in the man page, a short list of options can be viewed
by running
<pre class="screen">mplayer -zrhelp</pre>
</p><p>
Things like scaling and the OSD (on screen display) are not handled by
this driver but can be done using the video filters. For example, suppose
that you have a movie with a resolution of 512x272 and you want to view it
fullscreen on your DC10+. There are three main possibilities, you may scale
the movie to a width of 768, 384 or 192. For performance and quality reasons,
I would choose to scale the movie to 384x204 using the fast bilinear software
scaler. The command line is
<pre class="screen">
mplayer -vo zr -sws 0 -vf scale=384:204 <i><tt>movie.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
Cropping can be done by the <tt class="option">crop</tt> filter and by this
driver itself. Suppose that a movie is too wide for display on your Buz and
that you want to use <tt class="option">-zrcrop</tt> to make the movie less wide,
then you would issue the following command
<pre class="screen">
mplayer -vo zr -zrcrop 720x320+80+0 <i><tt>benhur.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
if you want to use the <tt class="option">crop</tt> filter, you would do
<pre class="screen">
mplayer -vo zr -vf crop=720:320:80:0 <i><tt>benhur.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
Extra occurrences of <tt class="option">-zrcrop</tt> invoke <span class="emphasis"><i>cinerama</i></span>
mode, i.e. you can distribute the movie over several TV's or beamers to create a
larger screen. Suppose you have two beamers. The left one is connected to your
Buz at <tt class="filename">/dev/video1</tt> and the right one is connected to
your DC10+ at <tt class="filename">/dev/video0</tt>. The movie has a resolution
of 704x288. Suppose also that you want the right beamer in black and white and
that the left beamer should have JPEG frames at quality 10, then you would
issue the following command
<pre class="screen">
mplayer -vo zr -zrdev /dev/video0 -zrcrop 352x288+352+0 -zrxdoff 0 -zrbw \
          -zrcrop 352x288+0+0 -zrdev /dev/video1 -zrquality 10 \
	  <i><tt>movie.avi</tt></i>
</pre>
</p><p>
You see that the options appearing before the second <tt class="option">-zrcrop</tt>
only apply to the DC10+ and that the options after the second
<tt class="option">-zrcrop</tt> apply to the Buz. The maximum number of MJPEG cards
participating in <span class="emphasis"><i>cinerama</i></span> is four, so you can build a
2x2 vidiwall.
</p><p>
Finally an important remark: Do not start or stop XawTV on the playback device
during playback, it will crash your computer. It is, however, fine to
<span class="bold"><b>FIRST</b></span> start XawTV, <span class="bold"><b>THEN</b></span>
start <span class="application">MPlayer</span>, wait for <span class="application">MPlayer</span>
to finish and <span class="bold"><b>THEN</b></span> stop XawTV.

TV output support for these cards has only been recently introduced, and is
not yet in the mainstream kernel. Currently the <span class="bold"><b>mga_vid</b></span>
module can't be used AFAIK, because the G450/G550 driver works only in one
configuration: the first CRTC chip (with much more features) on the first display
(on monitor), and the second CRTC (no <span class="bold"><b>BES</b></span> - for
explanation on BES, please see the G400 section above) on TV. So you can only
use <span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s <span class="emphasis"><i>fbdev</i></span> output driver
at the present.
</p><p>
The first CRTC can't be routed to the second head currently. The author of the
kernel matroxfb driver - Petr Vandrovec - will maybe make support for this, by
displaying the first CRTC's output onto both of the heads at once, as currently
recommended for G400, see the section above.
